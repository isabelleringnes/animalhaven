	Planned gifts are a powerful way to help Animal Haven continue our mission to rescue, nurture and adopt homeless animals long into the future. Planned giving can take many forms, but all share the unique characteristic that they allow you to ultimately donate more to help save the lives of animals than you may have ever thought possible while retaining the flexibility to donate conservatively during the course of your lifetime.
