	<h2>Support us</h2> 
	Planned gifts are a powerful way to help Animal Haven continue our mission to rescue, nurture and adopt homeless animals long into the future. Planned giving can take many forms, but all share the unique characteristic that they allow you to ultimately donate more to help save the lives of animals than you may have ever thought possible while retaining the flexibility to donate conservatively during the course of your lifetime. yes!

<ul class="bullets">
  <li> Naming Animal Haven a beneficiary of your Retirement Plan (IRA)</li><br>
  <li> Naming Animal Haven a beneficiary of a Life Insurance Policy</li><br>
  <li> Naming Animal Haven a beneficiary of a savings, checking, brokerage or other transfer on death account (TOD)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
	Each of these gifts will allow you to enjoy specific tax advantages as well, so we always recommend that you discuss your personal financial plan with a professional.

We encourage pet lovers who have made a planned gift to Animal Haven to let us know so that we can formally welcome them into the Animal Haven Legacy Society.
<br>
Society members are a treasured group of donors whose generosity will ensure that we can continue our good work for years to come.

If you would like to receive more information about planned giving, please contact Tiffany Lacey at 212.274.8511 or at TiffanyL@ah-nyc.org.
